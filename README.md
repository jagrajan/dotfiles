# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use in my day-to-day setup. A quick summary of what I use:

* [arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) (OS)
* [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) (window manager)
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) (text editor)
* [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) (file manager)
* [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) (status bar)
* [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) (application launcher/dmenu)
* [rxvt-unicode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode) (terminal)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (terminal multiplier)
* [compton](https://github.com/GabrielTenma/compton-kawase-blur) (composition)

A lot of stuff is taken from various configs around the internet.
